Analysis of Existing Solution vs. Current Issues
Looking at the files you've shared, I can see that you already have a comprehensive media validation and repair system implemented through Firebase Cloud Functions. Let me analyze how this relates to the current issues:

Existing Solution Components
Cloud Functions Architecture:

processMediaValidation: Processes tasks from a Pub/Sub queue
scheduledMediaValidation: Scheduled function running every 4 hours
Validation & Repair Logic:

validateAndRepairMedia(): Main function that handles both validation and repairs
Specific functions for processing different types of media fields:
processTopLevelMedia(): Handles the main media array
processImageFields(): Processes common image URL fields
processVirtualTourScenes(): Handles virtual tour media
Issue Detection & Fixing:

Relative URL detection and conversion to absolute URLs
Video content detection using patterns like -SBV-, .mp4, etc.
Blob URL handling
Why Issues Still Exist
The media validation errors we're seeing suggest that while the solution is well-designed, there are still issues present. This could be due to:

Timing/Execution Issues:

The cloud functions may not have run yet on the newer content
The scheduled function runs every 4 hours, so recent issues might not be fixed yet
Coverage Gaps:

Some collections or field patterns might not be covered by the current validation logic
The worker might be processing documents in batches and hasn't reached all content yet
Implementation State:

The cloud functions might not be deployed or might be disabled
There could be permission issues preventing the functions from updating documents
Base URL Configuration:

The code uses https://etoile-yachts.firebasestorage.app as the base URL, but your application might be hosted at a different URL
Recommended Approach
Since the solution is already in place but we're still seeing issues, I recommend:

Verify Function Deployment:

Check that the Cloud Functions are properly deployed and running
Review logs to see if they're encountering errors
Run Manual Validation:

Implement an admin endpoint to trigger validation on demand (instead of waiting for the schedule)
This could help fix the current issues right away
Expand Media Type Detection:

Review the VIDEO_PATTERNS array to ensure it covers all patterns in your data
Add additional patterns if needed based on the current errors
Adjust Base URL:

Verify that https://etoile-yachts.firebasestorage.app is the correct base URL
Update it if your application is hosted elsewhere
Add Error Reporting:

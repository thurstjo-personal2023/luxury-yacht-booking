Acceptance Criteria:

Image Upload & Validation:
Users can upload multiple images (or a short video) of the yacht.
The system validates the images against best practices for equirectangular panorama creation (e.g., sufficient overlap between shots, proper exposure, consistent white balance, minimum resolution, and an approximate 2:1 aspect ratio).
Clear guidance and in-app tips are provided to help users capture images correctly (e.g., recommended number of images, overlap percentage, camera settings).
AI-Powered Stitching API Integration:
The uploaded images are sent to an AI-based stitching service via an API.
The system leverages either an existing commercial solution (e.g., Adobe Photoshop API leveraging Adobe Sensei technology) or a custom microservice built on open-source stitching tools (e.g., a wrapped version of Hugin) to process and merge the images into a seamless equirectangular panorama.
The API returns a high-resolution 360° panoramic image that meets the equirectangular standard (with a 2:1 aspect ratio).
Panorama Display with Pannellum:
The generated panoramic image is stored in the platform’s media storage (e.g., Firebase Storage).
The application integrates with Pannellum to render the 360° panorama on both web and mobile devices.
Users (consumers, producers, and partners) can interact with the panorama (e.g., zoom, pan, rotate) in a responsive viewer.
Error Handling & Feedback:
The system provides clear error messages if the image stitching fails (e.g., due to insufficient overlap or poor image quality) and offers guidance on how to retake images.
If the AI API or stitching service is unavailable, the system falls back to a cached version or prompts the user to try again later.
Simplicity & Automation:
The entire process—from image upload, through automatic stitching, to panorama display—is designed to minimize manual intervention.
A progress indicator keeps the user informed while the panorama is being generated.
Once complete, the panorama is automatically linked to the yacht’s listing on the platform.

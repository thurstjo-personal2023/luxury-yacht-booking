Objective
Enable Producers (Yacht Owners) to bundle their own Service Add-Ons and Product Add-Ons with those created by Partners (Water Sports Instructors, Caterers, etc.) within the Yacht Experience Form.

Current Application Overview
User Roles : Consumers, Producers, and Partners.
Producer Journey : Manage yacht listings, handle booking requests, update availability, track earnings, respond to reviews, manage compliance documents.
Partner Journey : Create and manage service add-ons, track usage of services, monitor revenue and commissions, update service availability.
Separate Entities : Yacht Experiences, Service Add-Ons, and Product Add-Ons are currently managed separately by Producers and Partners.
Analysis Steps
Review Existing Functionality
Analyze the current Yacht Experience Form structure and data model.
Identify how Service Add-Ons and Product Add-Ons are currently stored and linked to Yacht Experiences.
Review the role-based access control mechanisms to ensure security when bundling services.
Data Model Assessment
Evaluate the Firestore collections (unified_yacht_experiences, service_add_ons, product_add_ons) to understand relationships between entities.
Determine if additional fields or subcollections are needed to support bundled services.
Frontend Integration
Inspect the React components used for creating and managing Yacht Experiences.
Assess how these components can be extended to include Partner’s Service Add-Ons selection.
Backend API Review
Examine the Express.js API endpoints related to Yacht Experiences and Add-Ons.
Ensure the API supports fetching Partner’s Add-Ons and linking them to Yacht Experiences.
Security Considerations
Validate that Firebase Authentication and custom claims allow Producers to access Partner’s Add-Ons while maintaining role-based restrictions.
Proposed Solution
Enhance Yacht Experience Form
Modify the form to include a section where Producers can select Partner’s Service Add-Ons.
Implement a searchable dropdown or list view to display available Partner Add-Ons.
Update Data Model
Introduce a new field in unified_yacht_experiences to store an array of Partner Add-On IDs.
Ensure data consistency and integrity through Zod schemas.
Extend Backend Logic
Update the relevant API endpoint to accept and process Partner Add-On selections.
Implement server-side validation to prevent unauthorized bundling.
Frontend Adjustments
Utilize React Query to fetch Partner Add-Ons dynamically.
Use Zustand stores to manage selected Add-Ons state during form submission.
Testing & Validation
Develop test cases to verify successful bundling of services.
Perform role-based testing to ensure security constraints are honored.

Debugging Tips
Search (Filtering)
Ensure that the location.address field in Firestore matches the values used in the filters (e.g., "Dubai Marina" or "Yas Marina").
Use console.log(filteredPackages) to debug the filtering logic.
Recommended Packages
Check if there are any experience_packages in Firestore that match the recommendation criteria.
Test the query in the Firestore Console to ensure it returns results.

Summary
Search (Filtering) :
Implemented sequential filtering based on category, region, and pier.
Used .filter() to dynamically update the displayed packages.
Recommended Packages :
Defined recommendation criteria (e.g., tags, ratings, availability).
Queried Firestore to fetch and display recommended packages.
By following these steps, you should be able to fix both the filtering and recommendation issues.Please do your analysis of my views and then implement the necessary modifications to both the front and back end to resolve these problems.

I understand the issues you've highlighted and will implement the necessary changes to fix both the search filtering and recommended packages functionality. Let me first fix the search functionality to show all packages initially and then apply progressive filtering.

Improve Firebase emulator configuration and enhance experience filtering and fetching.

After updating the Firebase emulator connections, can you check if the experience packages are now visible in both the Recommended tab and Search&Book tab?

Yes, I'll continue implementing the search filtering and recommended packages functionality. I'll make sure the search shows all packages initially and implements progressive filtering, while also fixing the recommended packages display.

Fix: Enhance search filtering and recommended packages functionality. Improved filtering logic and corrected collection name for experience packages.

AI
I've updated the experience packages filtering and recommendations. Can you check if: 1. All experiences are shown initially on the Search&Book tab, 2. Filtering works progressively when selecting options, and 3. Featured experiences are showing on the Recommended tab?

To update the Profile Section in the Consumer Dashboard (ConsumerUpdated.tsx) to align with the luxury-themed design requirements and profile fields, here’s a detailed layout for the necessary changes:

1. Structural Changes
Redesign Layout:
Implement a two-column layout for desktops and a single-column layout for mobile.
Use cards with soft shadows and rounded corners for each section.
Integrate accordion-style collapsible sections for secondary details (e.g., Demographics).
Add hover animations and subtle transitions to interactive elements.
2. Updated Profile Sections
Basic Information (Always Visible at the Top)
Large profile picture with an upload option (drag & drop or click-to-upload).
Full name, email, and phone number displayed prominently.
Use editable input fields with real-time validation (e.g., email format).
Demographics (Collapsible Section)
Fields: Date of Birth, Gender (optional), Nationality
Minimalist dropdowns and date-picker components.
Collapsed by default for a cleaner UI.
Account Preferences (Card-Style Format)
Preferred language and currency with dropdown selectors.
Dark mode toggle switch for personalization.
Save button with real-time confirmation messages.
Travel & Experience Preferences (Interactive Elements)
Multi-select chips for activity preferences (e.g., snorkeling, luxury dining).
Checkboxes/toggles for dietary restrictions and accessibility needs.
Editable favorite destinations (with a suggested destinations dropdown).
Loyalty Program (Visually Engaging UI)
Progress bar for loyalty tier (Bronze → Silver → Gold).
Badge icons for achievements.
Rewards history displayed in a scrollable list with icons.
Booking & Past Interactions (Collapsible Section)
Display past bookings in a timeline view.
List reviews & ratings submitted with interactive filters.

Emergency Contact (Collapsible Section)

Editable in case of last-minute updates.
3. Interactive Enhancements
Edit icons next to each section for quick modifications.
Inline validation messages (e.g., "Invalid email format" in red text).
Tooltips for helper text in empty fields (e.g., "Add your favorite destinations").
Save & Cancel buttons appear dynamically when fields are modified.
4. Visual Styling Upgrades
Luxury-inspired color palette (dark navy, gold accents, white backgrounds).
Subtle gradient effects on buttons and card headers.
Hover animations for buttons and icons.
Elegant font selection (e.g., Playfair Display for headers, Montserrat for body text).

To implement the "Explore as a Guest" functionality, we need to ensure that users who choose this option are redirected to a dashboard-like page with generic recommendations and no personalized booking data. This functionality should mimic the behavior of a logged-in user but without requiring authentication or displaying any user-specific information.

Here’s a prompt you can provide to Replit to explain the problem and request a solution:

Prompt for Replit
"I need help implementing the 'Explore as a Guest' functionality for my application. Here’s the problem:

Current Behavior :
The 'Explore as a Guest' button is already present on the Home Page.
When clicked, it does not redirect the user to a guest-friendly dashboard.
Desired Behavior :
When a user clicks the 'Explore as a Guest' button:
They should be redirected to a dashboard-like page.
The page should display generic recommendations (e.g., popular yacht packages, add-ons, etc.).
No personalized booking data should be shown since the user is not logged in.
The guest experience should resemble the logged-in customer dashboard but without requiring authentication.
Requirements :
Create a new route or page for the guest dashboard.
Populate the guest dashboard with generic content (e.g., hardcoded or fetched from a mock API).
Ensure the 'Explore as a Guest' button redirects to this page.
Please provide a solution that includes:

A step-by-step guide to implement the functionality.
Example code for creating the guest dashboard and handling the redirection.
Suggestions for displaying generic recommendations (e.g., using static data or a mock API).
Ensure the solution is beginner-friendly and suitable for testing in a Replit environment."
Proposed Solution
Below is a step-by-step explanation of how to implement the "Explore as a Guest" functionality, along with example code.

1. Add a Route for the Guest Dashboard
Create a new route in your application to handle the guest dashboard. This route will serve as the landing page for users who click the "Explore as a Guest" button.

Example Code for Routing:

// Assuming you're using Express.js for routing
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Serve static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS)
app.use(express.static("public"));

// Route for the guest dashboard
app.get("/guest-dashboard", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/public/guest-dashboard.html");
});

// Start the server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
2. Create the Guest Dashboard Page
Design a simple HTML page for the guest dashboard. This page should display generic recommendations and a welcoming message.

/**
 * Firebase Type Augmentations
 * 
 * This file extends Firebase types to work better with our testing tools.
 * It provides type shims to allow our tests to compile despite type mismatches.
 */

// Instead of trying to augment complex generic types, we'll use @ts-ignore comments
// in our test files where needed. This is a more pragmatic approach since the Firebase
// typings are quite complex with their generics.

// This file is kept as a placeholder and to document our approach to handling
// Firebase type issues in tests.

// The main issues we're working around:
// 1. Property 'doc' does not exist on CollectionReference
// 2. Property 'delete' does not exist on FirebaseApp
// 3. Using Query results as CollectionReference

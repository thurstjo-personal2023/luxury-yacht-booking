# Booking System Refactoring Report

## Overview

The booking system has been refactored using Clean Architecture principles to improve maintainability, testability, and scalability. This report summarizes the progress made, the current state of the implementation, and outlines the next steps.

## Completed Tasks

### Domain Layer
✅ Created core domain entities:
- `Booking` - Central entity representing a booking in the system
- `BookingItem` - Represents items within a booking (yacht, experience, add-ons)
- `TimeSlot` - Value object for booking time slots
- `BookingStatus` - Enum representing booking status
- `PaymentDetails` - Value object for payment information
- `PaymentStatus` - Enum representing payment processing status
- `CustomerDetails` - Value object for customer information

✅ Implemented domain services:
- `BookingService` - Core business logic for booking operations
- `PricingService` - Handles price calculations for bookings
- `AvailabilityService` - Checks availability of yachts and packages

✅ Defined repository interfaces:
- `IBookingRepository` - Interface for booking data access
- `IYachtRepository` - Interface for yacht and package data access

### Application Layer
✅ Implemented use cases:
- `CreateBookingUseCase` - For creating new bookings
- `ConfirmBookingUseCase` - For confirming pending bookings
- `CancelBookingUseCase` - For canceling bookings
- `GetBookingUseCase` - For retrieving booking details
- `SearchBookingsUseCase` - For searching and filtering bookings
- `CheckAvailabilityUseCase` - For checking availability before booking

### Adapter Layer
✅ Implemented repository adapters:
- `FirestoreBookingRepository` - Firestore implementation of booking repository
- `FirestoreYachtRepository` - Firestore implementation of yacht repository
- `RepositoryFactory` - Factory for creating repository instances

### Infrastructure Layer
✅ Implemented API infrastructure:
- `BookingController` - Handles HTTP requests for booking operations
- `BookingRoutes` - Defines API routes for booking endpoints
- `Integration Module` - Integrates clean architecture with existing Express server

✅ Added data migration utilities:
- `BookingMigration` - Migrates existing booking data to new structure

### Testing
✅ Created unit tests:
- Tests for repository adapters
- Tests for API controllers

## Current Issues

The implementation currently has several TypeScript issues that need to be resolved:

1. **Interface Mismatches**: Several interfaces don't align perfectly, causing TypeScript errors.
2. **Enum References**: References to enum values aren't consistent across the codebase.
3. **Repository Methods**: Some repository method signatures need adjustment.
4. **Controller I/O Types**: The controller interfaces and test files need alignment with use case outputs.

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. **Fix TypeScript Issues**: 
   - Resolve interface mismatches 
   - Standardize enum references
   - Fix method signatures

2. **Complete Test Coverage**:
   - Add missing tests for domain entities
   - Add tests for domain services
   - Add tests for use cases

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test integration with existing Express server
   - Verify API endpoints with real data

### Medium-term Tasks
1. **Implement Event System**:
   - Add domain events for booking status changes
   - Create event handlers for notifications

2. **Improve Validation**:
   - Add Zod schemas for input validation
   - Create custom validation rules for business logic

3. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Implement domain-specific exceptions
   - Create consistent error responses

### Long-term Goals
1. **Complete Migration**:
   - Migrate all booking-related functionality to clean architecture
   - Phase out legacy booking implementation

2. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Create admin dashboard UI for booking management
   - Add reporting capabilities

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add batch processing for large datasets

## Conclusion

The refactoring to clean architecture has established a solid foundation for the booking system. The separation of concerns and clear boundaries between layers has improved the maintainability and testability of the codebase. The next steps focus on resolving current issues, completing test coverage, and gradually migrating all booking functionality to the new architecture.
